# Contributors

## Project Lead
- **Hosein Fooladi** - Project creator and maintainer

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! Here's how you can help:

1. **Fork** the repository
2. Create a new **branch** for your feature or bugfix
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a **pull request**

### Types of Contributions We're Looking For

- Bug fixes and improvements
- New GNN implementations
- Documentation improvements
- Tutorial notebooks


### Working with Notebooks and Python Files

**Important**: For easier tracking and review of changes, we maintain both Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) and Python script (`.py`) versions of all tutorials. These Python files are created using Jupyter Text.

**For Contributors**: 
- Please make your changes to the **Python files** (`.py`) rather than the Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`)
- Python files are located in the `notebooks/` directory alongside their corresponding notebooks
- This makes it much easier to track changes, review diffs, and manage pull requests
- The Python files contain the same content as the notebooks but in a more version-control-friendly format

### Pull Request Process

1. Make changes to the **Python files** (`.py`) rather than notebooks (`.ipynb`)
2. Update documentation if necessary
3. Provide a clear description of your changes
4. Reference any related issues
