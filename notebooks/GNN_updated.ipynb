    "# Graph Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, the biggest difficulty for machine learning with molecules was the choice and computation of \"descriptors\". Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a category of deep neural networks whose inputs are graphs and provide a way around the choice of descriptors. A GNN can take a molecule directly as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this chapter, you should be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Represent a molecule in a graph\n",
    "  * Discuss and categorize common graph neural network architectures\n",
    "  * Build a GNN and choose a read-out function for the type of labels\n",
    "  * Distinguish between graph, edge, and node features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "GNNs are specific layers that input a graph and output a graph. You can find reviews of GNNs in Dwivedi *et al.*{cite}`dwivedi2020benchmarking`, Bronstein *et al.*{cite}`bronstein2017geometric`, and  Wu *et al.*{cite}`wu2020comprehensive`. GNNs can be used for everything from coarse-grained molecular dynamics {cite}`li2020graph` to predicting NMR chemical shifts {cite}`yang2020predicting` to modeling dynamics of solids {cite}`xie2019graph`. Before we dive too deep into them, we must first understand how a graph is represented in a computer and how molecules are converted into graphs.\n",

    "You can find an interactive introductory article on graphs and graph neural networks at [distill.pub](https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/) {cite}`sanchez-lengeling2021a`. Most current research in GNNs is done with specialized deep learning libraries for graphs.

    "## Representing a Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph $\\mathbf{G}$ is a set of nodes $\\mathbf{V}$ and edges $\\mathbf{E}$. In our setting, node $i$ is defined by a vector $\\vec{v}_i$, so that the set of nodes can be written as a rank 2 tensor. The edges can be represented as an adjacency matrix $\\mathbf{E}$, where if $e_{ij} = 1$ then nodes $i$ and $j$ are connected by an edge. In many fields, graphs are often immediately simplified to be directed and acyclic, which simplifies things. Molecules are instead undirected and have cycles (rings). Thus, our adjacency matrices are always symmetric $e_{ij} = e_{ji}$ because there is no concept of direction in chemical bonds. Often our edges themselves have features, so that $e_{ij}$ is itself a vector. Then the adjacency matrix becomes a rank 3 tensor. Examples of edge features might be covalent bond order or distance between two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how a graph can be constructed from a molecule. Consider methanol, shown in the figure. I've numbered the atoms so that we have an order for defining the nodes/edges. First, the node features. You can use anything for node features, but often we'll begin with one-hot encoded feature vectors:\n",

    "$\\mathbf{V}$ will be the combined feature vectors of these nodes. The adjacency matrix $\\mathbf{E}$ will look like:\n",

    "Take a moment to understand these two. For example, notice that rows 1, 2, and 3 only have the 4th column as non-zero. That's because atoms 1-3 are bonded only to carbon (atom 4). Also, the diagonal is always 0 because atoms cannot be bonded with themselves.\n",

    "This is a small change. We have one weight vector per node now. This makes the trainable weights depend on the ordering of the nodes. Then if we swap the node ordering, our weights will no longer align. So if we were to input two methanol molecules, which should have the same output, but we switched two atom numbers, we would get different answers. These simple examples differ from real GNNs in two important ways: (i) they give a single feature vector output, which throws away per-node information, and (ii) they do not use the adjacency matrix. Let's see a real GNN that has these properties while maintaining permutation invariance --- or equivariance (swapping inputs swaps outputs the same way)."

    "## Kipf & Welling GCN\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first popular GNNs was the Kipf & Welling graph convolutional network (GCN) {cite}`kipf2016semi`. Although some people consider GCNs to be a broad class of GNNs, we'll use GCNs to refer specifically the Kipf & Welling GCN.\n",
    "Thomas Kipf has written an [excellent article introducing the GCN](https://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The input to a GCN layer is $\\mathbf{V}$, $\\mathbf{E}$ and it outputs an updated $\\mathbf{V}'$. Each node feature vector is updated. The way it updates a node feature vector is by averaging the feature vectors of its neighbors, as determined by $\\mathbf{E}$. The choice of averaging over neighbors is what makes a GCN layer permutation equivariant. Averaging over neighbors is not trainable, so we must add trainable parameters. We multiply the neighbor features by a trainable matrix before the averaging, which gives the GCN the ability to learn. In Einstein notation, this process is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v_{il} = \\sigma\\left(\\frac{1}{d_i}e_{ij}v_{jk}w_{kl}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $i$ is the node we're considering, $j$ is the neighbor index, $k$ is the node input feature, $l$ is the output node feature, $d_i$ is the degree of node i (which makes it an average instead of sum), $e_{ij}$ isolates neighbors so that all non-neighbor $v_{jk}$s are zero, $\\sigma$ is our activation, and $w_{lk}$ is the trainable weights. This equation is a mouthful, but it truly just is the average over neighbors with a trainable matrix thrown in. One common modification is to make all nodes neighbors of themselves. This is so that the output node features $v_{il}$ depends on the input features $v_{ik}$. We do not need to change our equation, just make the adjacency matrix have $1$s on the diagonal instead of $0$ by adding the identity matrix during pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building understanding about the GCN is important for understanding other GNNs. You can view the GCN layer as a way to \"communicate\" between a node and its neighbors. The output for node $i$ will depend only on its immediate neighbors. For chemistry, this is not satisfactory. You can stack multiple layers though. If you have two layers, the output for node $i$ will include information about node $i$'s neighbors' neighbors. Another important detail to understand in GCNs is that the averaging procedure accomplishes two goals: (i) it gives permutation equivariance by removing the effect of neighbor order and (ii) it prevents a change in magnitude in node features. A sum would accomplish (i) but would cause the magnitude of the node features to grow after each layer. Of course, you could ad-hoc put a batch normalization layer after each GCN layer to keep output magnitudes stable but averaging is easy."
