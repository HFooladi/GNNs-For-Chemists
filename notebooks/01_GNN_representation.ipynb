    "\n",
    "Historically, the biggest difficulty for machine learning with molecules was the choice and computation of \"descriptors\". Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a category of deep neural networks whose inputs are graphs and provide a way around the choice of descriptors. A GNN can take a molecule directly as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "GNNs are specific layers that input a graph and output a graph. You can find reviews of GNNs in Dwivedi *et al.* [[1]](#dwivedi2020benchmarking), Bronstein *et al.* [[2]](#bronstein2017geometric), and Wu *et al.* [[3]](#wu2020comprehensive). GNNs can be used for everything from coarse-grained molecular dynamics [[4]](#li2020graph) to predicting molecular properties [[5]](#yang2020predicting) to modeling dynamics of solids [[6]](#xie2019graph). Before we dive too deep into them, we must first understand how a graph is represented in a computer and how molecules are converted into graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find an interactive introductory article on graphs and graph neural networks at [distill.pub](https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/) [[7]](#sanchez-lengeling2021a). Most current research in GNNs is done with specialized deep learning libraries for graphs. The most common are [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Deep Graph library](https://www.dgl.ai/), [DIG](https://github.com/divelab/DIG), [Spektral](https://graphneural.network/), and [TensorFlow GNNS](https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn).\n",

    "## 8. Conclusion <a name=\"conclusion\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways from this tutorial include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Molecules as Graphs**: Molecules can be naturally represented as graphs where atoms are nodes and chemical bonds are edges, allowing machine learning models to work directly with molecular structures rather than requiring hand-engineered descriptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**: Rich chemical information can be encoded in node features (atom properties like element type, hybridization, aromaticity) and edge features (bond properties like bond type, conjugation), providing models with important context about molecular behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **PyTorch Geometric Implementation**: Specialized libraries like PyTorch Geometric provide efficient data structures for molecular graphs, using sparse representations (COO format) and tensor formats that enable GPU acceleration for graph neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **MoleculeNet Datasets**: Resources like MoleculeNet provide standardized datasets for molecular property prediction tasks, facilitating model development and benchmarking for applications ranging from solubility to toxicity prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visualization Techniques**: Visualizing molecular graphs with highlighted features helps interpret how different molecular properties (aromaticity, ring membership, connectivity) are distributed through the structure, enabling better understanding of structure-property relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Resources for Further Learning\n",
