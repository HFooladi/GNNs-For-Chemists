    "## 1. Introduction <a name=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we learned how to represent molecules as graphs. Now we'll explore how GNNs leverage these representations through message passing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "After completing this chapter, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Describe what message passing is in a Graph Neural Network (GNN)\n",
    "- Understand permutation equivariance and permutation invariance\n",
    "- Visualize how message passing works on molecular graphs\n",
    "- Explain why GNNs are suitable for molecular property prediction\n",
    "- Implement a basic GNN message passing operation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review of Graph Theory Basics for Chemists\n",
    "Before diving into GNNs, let's briefly review some graph theory concepts as they apply to chemistry:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graph**: A mathematical structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges\n",
    "- **Molecular Graph**: A representation where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges\n",
    "- **Node Features**: Properties of atoms (e.g., atomic number, hybridization, formal charge)\n",
    "- **Edge Features**: Properties of bonds (e.g., bond type, bond order, length)\n",
    "- **Adjacency Matrix**: A matrix representation of connections between nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Connection**: In chemistry, we often deal with molecules where atom ordering is arbitrary. GNNs help us create models that respect this chemical reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Graph Neural Networks\n",
    "A graph neural network (GNN) is a neural network with two defining attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Its input is a graph\n",
    "2. Its output is permutation equivariant\n",
    "\n",
    "The first point is straightforward - a GNN processes data in graph format (nodes connected by edges).\n",
    "\n",
    "But what does \"permutation equivariant\" mean? In our molecular context, a permutation means re-ordering our atoms (nodes). For example, in methanol, we could re-number the atoms differently. Our goal is to ensure the GNN's output changes correspondingly with these renumberings."

    "2. **Message Transformation**: Each message is transformed using a learnable function (often a neural network)\n",
